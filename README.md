## Overview

This project focuses on performing Part of Speech (POS) tagging on Persian language text data. POS tagging is a crucial task in natural language processing that involves assigning a grammatical category (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each word in a given text. This project uses a dataset collected from Persian language texts to develop and evaluate machine learning models for POS tagging.

## Project Goals

The main goals of this project are as follows:

1. **Part of Speech Tagging**: The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately tagging each word in Persian text with its corresponding part of speech (POS).

2. **Feature Engineering**: Enhance the model's performance by creating additional features derived from the text data, such as prefix and suffix length, the presence of certain linguistic patterns, and more.

3. **Model Selection**: Experiment with various machine learning models, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Perceptron, and Logistic Regression, to determine the most suitable model for the task.

4. **Accuracy and Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the selected model(s) using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to measure how well the model can predict POS tags.

5. **Documentation**: Create clear and comprehensive documentation to explain the project's code, data preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a collection of Persian language texts. The dataset is labeled with part of speech (POS) tags, making it suitable for supervised machine learning. It includes the following columns:

- **token**: Represents individual words in Persian text.
- **part_of_speech**: Contains the true POS tags for each word.
- **label**: Contains the predicted POS tags generated by the machine learning models.

## Project Steps

The project follows these main steps:

### Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following software and libraries installed:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- PersianStemmer (for linguistic analysis)

### Importing Libraries

The necessary Python libraries are imported, including Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and others, to facilitate data analysis and modeling.

### Reading the Dataset

The dataset, collected from Persian language texts, is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis and modeling.

### Feature Engineering

Several new features are created to potentially improve the model's performance. These features include prefix and suffix length, the presence of specific linguistic patterns, and the last character of each word.

### Data Preprocessing

Categorical data, such as part_of_speech, is converted into numerical format using label encoding. Additionally, missing values are handled to ensure data consistency.

### Feature Selection

A thorough feature selection process is carried out by iteratively adding and discarding features to determine which combination yields the best model performance. The selected features are "token," "pos_tag," and "part_aft_1."

### Model Selection

Various machine learning models are tested and evaluated using the selected features. The models include Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Perceptron, and Logistic Regression.

### Model Evaluation

The performance of each model is assessed using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. Here are the evaluation results for each model:

- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**
  - Accuracy: 79.42%

- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
  - Accuracy: 62.78%

- **Decision Trees**
  - Accuracy: 96.79%

- **Perceptron**
  - Accuracy: 60.92%

- **Logistic Regression**
  - Accuracy: 74.79%

The results table shows the accuracy scores for each machine learning model.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the process of developing a POS tagging model for Persian text data. It demonstrates how feature engineering and model selection can significantly impact the accuracy of the tagging. The final model can be utilized for various natural language processing tasks in Persian text analysis.
